## NPOD Release Notes (Mac)

### 1.1.2 - 4/30/2014
Bug fixed: Image was updating daily at 3:42p instead of 12p.

### 1.1.1 - 4/12/2014
updates are now made at 12:00p EST instead of 10:30a. Sometimes the new image wouldn't post until after 10:30a so this accounts for that.  
now correctly accounts for daylight savings.  
if the image update fails (most likely no internet connection), then it will keep checking every hour until it succeeds.

### 1.1 - 2/7/2014
trimmed title and description text  
fixed a bug where title and description wouldn't update during a 10:30a update  
now supports three digit version numbers instead of just two  
added release notes link to auto-update popup  
fixed a bug where duplicate entries for NPOD would be made to login items when auto-updating

### 1.0 - 1/17/2014
